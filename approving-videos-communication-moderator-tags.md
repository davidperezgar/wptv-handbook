# Moderator Tags

As a moderator, you will often find it necessary to let other mods know about the status of a video you are working with. To do this, we use a list of the special “moderators tags” to mark videos in the queue to make other mods aware of the situation. You can also add a mod tag at any time, just be sure to come back and update the list here.

>**Note:** Modtags are usually in ALL CAPS and should be removed prior to publication.
