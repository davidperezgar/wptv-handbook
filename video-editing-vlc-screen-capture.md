# VLC Screen Capture

VLC is an open source cross-platform media player that can be used to capture a computer screen for a WordCamp presenter that is giving a live demonstration as part of the presentation.

VLC can be downloaded at this [link](http://www.videolan.org/vlc/).

>Be sure to start VLC before the presentation begins so you will be able to capture ALL the presentation – capturing the slides as well as the live demonstration.

>The slides will be cut out of the screen capture recording and the live demonstration will be edited into the actual presentation video.

After installing VLC click the icon VLC to open the program.
