# Handbook

## Welcome to the WordPress.tv Moderator Handbook

This handy handbook (See what I did there?) is the best place to learn how to get involved with producing, publishing, and translating/captioning videos on WordPress.tv.

Here you can learn about how the community moderator team is organized, communication channels, best practices, the video workflow process, and more.

There are also guides to help you set up the tools you’ll need to start contributing to WordPress.tv. You do not need to be a video expert or possess any special technical knowledge to help out. Anyone can join in the fun!

[info]Have a question? We use [Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/) for real-time communication. If you are looking to contribute and not sure where to begin, or are a content creator having trouble with your WordPress video, just say “hi” in our #wptv slack channel, and let us know what you need help with.

## How you can help

### Editing RAW WordCamp footage

The bulk of submissions to WordPress.tv come in the form of videos of WordCamp sessions across the globe. While some camps are able to budget for a production crew to help with their video needs (or have someone donate the time and expertise) most camps need help with editing and cleaning up their footage, so it is ready for publication. This is where you can help!

Even if you are not a video expert, if you have even the most basic of video editing software on your computer, you can help us:

- Cut and trim unneeded footage
- Include presentation slides, timed with the presentation
- Add title slides to the beginning and end of the video
- Compress and upload the finished video to WordPress.tv
- You can get started in our Post Production section of the [handbook here](https://make.wordpress.org/tv/handbook/video-editing/).

### Subtitling/Captioning videos

In addition to helping with the production of WordCamp videos, you can help us extend the reach of of WordPress.tv by adding captions or subtitles to any published video. Just find your favorite video, and follow the steps here to create a caption/translation file and submit for review.
