# Communication

As a moderator, you will often find it necessary to let other mods know about the status of a video you are working with. To do this, we use a list of special “moderators tags” to mark videos in the queue to make other mods aware of the situation.  You can add a new mod tag at any time, just be sure to come back and update the master list of mod tags on this page.

>**Note:** Mod tags are usually in ALL CAPS and should be removed prior to scheduling for publication.
