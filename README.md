# WordPress TV Handbook

This is the repository for the [WordPress TV Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/tv/handbook/).

The live Handbook is currently being migrated here, but the goal is to have the Handbook there directly generated from this repository.

## Getting Started

- **Discuss:** Conversations and discussions take place in [the #wptv channel](https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/wptv/) on the [Making WordPress Slack](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/).
- **Contribute:** Additions and changes to the Hosting Handbook happen in this GitHub repo. Get started by [reading the contributing guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md).
