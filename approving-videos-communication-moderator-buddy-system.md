# Moderator Buddy System

A new moderator will be paired with a lead moderator. In general, new moderators should communicate with their “buddy” using Slack.

The lead moderator will then assign the new moderator a video by entering the new moderator’s username in the tag file for the video. The new moderator will be notified (pinged) using Slack.

After reviewing all of the new moderator documentation, the new moderator will review the video. Once they have completed moderating the video, they should add the “READY TO PUBLISH” tag to the tag field. Be sure to leave the username in the tag field so the lead moderator can easily find the video. The new moderator should then notify (ping) the lead moderator that the video is ready for review.

The lead moderator will then review the video, will make any corrections, and then will publish the video. Any feedback about corrections that are made to the video will be pinged to the new moderator using Slack.

The lead moderator will then assign another video to the new moderator and the process will repeat.

Once the lead moderator is satisfied that the new moderator can consistently meet the quality standards for publishing video then the new moderator will be notified that they can stop using the “READY TO PUBLISH” tag and directly publish videos.
