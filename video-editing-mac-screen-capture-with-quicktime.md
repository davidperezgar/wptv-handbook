# Mac Screen Capture with QuickTime

The built-in QuickTime Player application can be used to capture a computer screen for a WordCamp presenter that is giving a live demonstration as part of the presentation.

>*Important:* Be sure to start the QuickTime Player before the presentation begins so you will be able to capture ALL of the presentation – the slides as well as the live demonstration.

The slides will be cut out of the screen capture recording and the live demonstration will be edited into the actual presentation video.

## Step 1: Open QuickTime Player.

To use the screen capture feature, select “File” from the menu bar
and select “New Screen Recording” …

Step 3: Saving your recording
After you have stopped your screen recording, be sure to save the movie that is now open in QuickTime Player.

Important: Quicktime screen recordings are not autosaved, so be sure to save the recording after your presentation is over.

Once you have saved your screen recording, you can transfer it to a disk or upload it as instructed by your WordCamp speaker coordinator.
