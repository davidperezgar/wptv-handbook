# How to publish a WordPress version release video

The process for publishing the official launch video for a new version of WordPress is a bit different than your standard WordPress.tv video, due to the need to keep things hush-hush until the official announcement post goes out on the main WordPress.org blog.

This is tricky, as to add subtitles to a video it needs to be published but in a way that is non-public, so that captions can be added.  To do that, the video is published as “private” initially, and then the video is set to public after announcement. Here are the steps in detail:

1. Upload video to WordPress.tv here: http://wordpress.tv/submit-video/
2. Use the title format: `Introducing WordPress X.X "Jazzer"`
3. Approve necessary info and include tags for”Featured” “Subtitles” and “Captions”
4. Un-check Twitter publicize connection
5. Set post visibility to private and publish post with video
6. Upload subtitle files to using the front end uploader on the published video – requires the person uploading the video to have WordPress.tv admin access. Tip: a list of Language abbreviations and their found [here](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/teams/#all)
7. Approve all uploaded subtitles
8. Provide video link to whoever is writing the launch post (VideoPress shortcode not recommended so oembed is preferred)
9. After announcement post is made, set WordPress.tv post back to “draft” and re-select the Twitter publicize option
10. Publish to WordPress.tv so it is public

#### A few notes

* Subtitles will not be visible on the video while the post on WordPress.tv is set to “Private” but are viewable when it is set to public finally
* Be sure to unselect the publicize option to Twitter before clicking the button to update the post for any changes you make. It tends to “re-select” itself, so better safe than sorry. 😉
