# Approval Standards

### What, When, How Many?

Only review videos in the pending queue, and approve the content submitted by the uploader. When videos are ready to publish, add the READY TO PUBLISH tag. A senior mod will do a final check and then make the video live on the site.

### Video Guidelines

Some items to keep in mind as you are reviewing videos:

1. Does the presentation/video/sound quality make it impossible to learn from this video?
2. Did the WordCamp put sponsor logos on the video? Is there a fauxgo (fake logo) in the video? If so, do not publish the video(s). Instead, contact the WordCamp organizer and ask them to edit the video(s).
3. Is there offensive or incorrect content in the video? If so, do not publish.
 
### Comment Guidelines
1. Comments should further the discussion on the topic.
2. Comments on video quality should not be approved.
