# Approving Manual Submissions

### What are manual submissions?

Unlike most videos we receive at wordpress.tv, which are submitted using the [public uploader](http://wordpress.tv/submit-video/), occasionally we get private submissions by admins to the site, which are just blog posts created manually in the wordpress.tv dashboard. You will see these when:

* A WordCamp organizer has been added to the site and given permission to upload/create posts manually
* Videos have been submitted to our Amazon S3 account for a staff member to upload/create posts manually

### Adding/checking video metadata
Make sure you have information in the following fields in the post editor, using the examples as a guide.

* **Title** – John Doe: Title of the talk
* **Speaker** – John Doe
* **Event** – WordCamp Metropolis 2012
* **Language** – English
* **Excerpt** – Add a short video description
* **Video Information** – Add a URL to the presentations slides
* **Categories** – WordCamp TV, Metropolis, 2012, Slides, and anything else that fits with the video content
* **Tags** – Add any tags you think are relevant, and be sure to remove modtags like NEEDS SLIDES, etc.

### Watching the video and setting thumbnails
Because manual submissions do not have a video preview or the ability to set thumbnails, a little extra effort is required to prepare these videos for moderation. To locate the video, click on the “Add Media” button and choose the “Uploaded to this post” option in the Media type drop-down menu. Then, click on the video file shown (there should be only one) to display the media details in the sidebar. From there, edit the following:

* **Video Title:** Edit the title of the media to match the “Speaker Name: Title of the talk” format used for post titles.
* **Preview Video and Set Thumbnail:** Click on the video thumbnail in the sidebar (you may need to scroll) to launch a player where you can preview the video and set a custom thumbnail.

When you are done, click the “X” button to close the media modal. Your edits will be saved automatically.

### Previewing and scheduling

As with all videos, be sure to preview the video to ensure that it will appear correctly to visitors to the site and then schedule the video for publication as you would with any video submission.
