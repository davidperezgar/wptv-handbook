# Contributor Day

This guide is intended to help you get started contributing to the WordPress.tv team at a contributor day. If you need any help, talk to your contributor day organizer, your table lead or ask in the #wptv channel on Slack.

## Resources for table lead

### Before the event

- Check with the Contributor Day lead that the IP address that will be used has been whitelisted. This can be done by joining the #Meta channel in slack 1 or 2 days before the event and explaining there.
- ‘Reserve’ some videos from the [video editing list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16y7U6icEeexSbifVj7eIuApiHQ5CqyDMAVKxyyujycA/edit) just to be sure to have videos to edit.
- As the WiFi download speed might not be optimal, consider downloading some (shorter) videos on e.g. a memory stick to use during Contrib Day.

### During the event
It all started [here](https://wordpress.org/news/2009/01/wordpresstv/):
Ask all people to create a [slack account](https://make.wordpress.org/chat/), then [join our channel](https://wordpress.slack.com/messages/wptv) for any questions.

Example of slides by Pascal for a Contrib day in 2017: https://speakerdeck.com/epascalc/contribute-to-wordpress-dot-tv
When WordCamps are over, people can submit the videos using the standard submit form http://wordpress.tv/submit-video/ (Preferred if all videos already have the intro and are below 1GB. This is the fastest way to get them on WPTV). If they prefer to do a bulk upload, then we have AWS and expect a ‘meta data file’, see https://make.wordpress.org/tv/handbook/about/upload-s3/

Explain the [video submission guidelines](about-video-submission-guidelines.md) because people not always know what to keep in mind while filming.

Since end of last year we are pushing all WordCamp videos from 2018 and further onto [youtube](http://youtube.com/wordpress), but we are still working on automating that.
