# Most common moderator mistakes

## WordPress.tv

### Approving speakers

* Do not wildly ‘Approve’ speakers if you have doubts on the name. Start typing their name in the Speakers box to see if they exist already and then select them. Only add a new speaker if you are really sure.
* Multiple speaker need to be separated. So not ‘A and B’ but ‘A’, ‘B’

### Approving Events

* Do not wildly ‘Approve’ Events if you have a doubt. Start typing the event name in the ‘Event’ box and when it pops up in the list, select it. Only add a new one if you are really sure.
* WordCamps: WordCamp Madrid 2020
* Meetups: WordPress Meetup Madrid

### Meetups do not take a date (normally)
* Only if a meetup is really producing a lot of videos, a date or follow up number could be added to the event, but the standard ‘WordPress Meetup <city>’ is our default. So 1 event for all meetup videos.
* However any video that is published in that event should have the correct year tag (e.g. 2020)

### Comments – link to slides

When approving comments, if there is a comment with a link to the slides, don’t forget to also add that link into the correct field on the post

### Post title should only have one colon ':'
  
The title of the post should have the Speaker(s) followed by a colon ‘:’ and then the title. If the title of the talk contains a colon, try to replace it with ‘ – ‘ or whatever is appropriated.

### Twitter message
  
Don’t forget to add the twitter handle of the speaker, the hash or twitter handle of the event, etc before hitting the publish button. Of course the start of the message is Speaker(s) followed by a colon ‘:’ and then the title. E.g.
**Speaker: Post title @WCtwitter #WCHASH @speakername**

### Missing Tags
Tags is what people look for e.g. ‘block editor’ or ‘translation’. Give multiple useful tags so people can find the videos they look for.
  
### Categories
WordCampTV should only be applied to WordCamps. Choose the correct categories (we should review them).
