# Approving Videos

Welcome to wordpress.tv! Moderating content here is a fairly simple process. However, wordpress.tv has a few custom features you’ll need to familiarize yourself with and there are some manual tasks that you will need to perform to moderate video content.

The following video and text instructions cover some basic guidelines for moderating a video (WordCamp, meetup, tutorial, etc.) on wordpress.tv. There are also several related manual pages that explain our procedures in-depth and provide background on any edge cases you may run across when reviewing videos.

## Text Instructions

### Step 1 – Go to Posts→All Posts→Pending

To locate videos in need of moderation, log in to [wptv.wordpress.com]([url](https://wptv.wordpress.com/wp-admin)) and go to Posts→All Posts. Videos to be moderated are in the pending queue; click on Pending to see the videos that need moderating.

Any video in the pending queue that has WordPress.tv as the author is available for moderation. If a video has someone’s name in the author field, then this video has already been selected for moderation by that person.

You will also notice that all recent uploads (from the video submitter) will show Uploaded Video in the Title field.  In some cases, another moderator may go through and save the titles to these videos to make it easier to see what the video is about.  Click “Edit” to choose one that you want to moderate.

### Step 3 – Review the video

Moderating the video itself primarily means watching for the following things:

* Can you hear the speaker clearly?
* Can you see the speaker and the presentation? (If there is not a visable presentation, is there a link to slides?)
* Is the content of the talk factually accurate?
* Is there anything that violates GPL/community guidelines?

Your goals while moderating the video are to watch for appropriate content and to make sure the video is usable. You can use the WordCamp submission guidelines for help. If you have a difficult time viewing or hearing the presentation, then it is likely others will not find viewing the video to be a useful experience either.

If there is a problem with the video then use the tag field to mark the issue. `NEEDS SLIDES`, `POOR AUDIO` or `POOR VIDEO` for instance. If the video is appropriate to publish, put `READY TO PUBLISH` in the tag field. This lets a lead moderator know to review the video for publication.

**Note:** Tags that you see associated with videos that are in [`[ALL CAPS]`](https://make.wordpress.org/tv/handbook/approving-videos/communication/moderator-tags/) are considered to be `MOD TAGS` and are what we use to communicate to other mods regarding issues with certain videos. Feel free to add your own, and make sure to remove any [`[MOD TAGS]`](https://make.wordpress.org/tv/handbook/approving-videos/communication/moderator-tags/) you see before scheduling a video for publication.

### Step 4 – Edit/approve the supplied video info

There are two methods for submitting videos to WPTV.  Videos are uploaded using the public submission form on WordPress.tv or they are uploaded manually using the Media Uploader, which attaches the video to a newly created post. Each of these methods produces a different edit screen.

If the submit form was used, then you will find information that was entered by the submitter when the video was uploaded directly under the video preview. In most cases this information is accurate, but you check it for accuracy as well as edit the format for consistency. Pay particular attention to the “Event” field since this field impacts search results.

Once you have checked each field, click on the “Approve” button next to that field. This will place the submitter information into the related modules in the post editor. Once the “Approve” button has been clicked, the information in these text fields cannot be edited again (you’ll notice that the “Approve” button will be greyed-out). If you need to make any edits to this information after clicking the “Approve” button then you will need to make those edits in the related module field since any edit in a greyed-out “Approve” field will not be passed on to the modules.

Where submitter info is mapped in the post editor:

**Note:** Once you have clicked the “Submit” button, you cannot edit the text in the submitter fields (You will see the submit button is greyed-out) in which case you will need to find the associated post meta box, as shown in the table above.
