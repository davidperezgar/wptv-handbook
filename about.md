## What is the WordPress.tv Mod Squad?

We are the team of humans who watch and approve every video that is published on WordPress.tv. We make sure that videos are accurate, high quality, open source, and community-friendly. The videos we moderate come primarily from WordCamp sessions around the globe, but also include WordPress Meetups and other events where WordPress is the focus. We help to make WordPress.tv the source for video.

## Why do we need moderators?

Because it is desirable to have your WordPress event published on WordPress.tv, we always have a steady supply of videos submitted to us. However, videos can vary in quality, and sometimes need a bit of work to be ‚Äúready‚Äù for publication on WordPress.tv, so there is always a need for help from the community!

There are a lot of great reasons to get involved with the WordPress.tv moderator squad, especially if you like video! You can:

- Watch great WordPress videos before anyone else does.
- Learn new WordPress skills and help you up your game.
- Gain some expertise in video production.
- Help your local WordCamp to get all it‚Äôs videos published.
- Help build WordPress.tv as a resource for all WordPress lovers.

Being a WordPress.tv Moderator is a win-win situation. You get to give back, but you also get to improve your own WordPress skills and learn how to handle and publish video.
