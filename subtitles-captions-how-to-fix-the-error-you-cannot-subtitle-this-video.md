# How to Fix the Error: “You Cannot Subtitle This Video”

## Text Instructions

For some older WordPress.tv videos, it may not be possible to upload subtitles properly.  This is due to a past problem where videos were not attached to posts correctly.

## Step 1 – Verify the Video is Impacted by this Issue

View the video from within the post editor in the WordPress.tv dashboard.
Click the “Add Media” button.

Choose “Uploaded to this post” from the media filter selector.
If you see a “No items found” message, you will need to manually attach the video to the post.

## Step 2 – Manually Attach the Video to the Post

Go back to the post editor.

Click on the “Edit attachment” link, which will launch the Edit Media page.

On the Edit Media page, copy the title for this video.

Return to the post editor and once again click on the “Add Media” button.

Choose the “All media items” filter, and then paste your video title into the  search box on the right.

This should find your unattached video, which you can insert into the post.

You will now see in the post content area that the same video shortcode is repeated twice.  You can remove one of the shortcodes, it does not matter which.

Update the post to save your changes.

## Step 3 – Verify the Ability to Add Subtitles to the Video

View the video on WordPress.tv to confirm that it is now possible to add subtitles to this post by clicking the “Subtitle this video” link.
